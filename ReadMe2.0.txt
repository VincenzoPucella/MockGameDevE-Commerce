- With this current version of my web app, it is to difficult to   maintain in the long term

- Here is my gameplan to make my Version1.0 and turn it into Version2.0

1) Create seperate CSS / JS files dedicated to the header / footer
2) Create a CSS script / JS script for Animations / Interactions in the    web 
3) Every html page has its own JS and CSS script for flexibility / Easy to improve

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps to get my project from 1.0 to 2.0

1) Version control / Commit the 1.0 version
